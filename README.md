# HelloToast Android Application

## Overview

HelloToast is a simple Android application that demonstrates basic user interaction and layout design. The app features two buttons and a text view:

1. Toast Button: Displays a short message (Toast) when pressed.
2. Count Button: Increments a counter and displays the current count in a TextView.

The application employs two distinct types of layouts:
- ConstraintLayout
- LinearLayout
These layout types allow for flexible and efficient UI design within the application.

## Features

- Display Toast messages
- Increment and display a counter
- Demonstrate usage of ConstraintLayout and LinearLayout

## Layout Comparison

### ConstraintLayout

ConstraintLayout offers enhanced flexibility for positioning and sizing child views. While it has a steeper learning curve, it enables the creation of responsive designs that adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes.
### LinearLayout

LinearLayout organizes its child views in a single row or column. It is straightforward to implement, making it suitable for simpler layouts, but it lacks the versatility needed for more complex designs.
